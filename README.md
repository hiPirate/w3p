## **web3-python: A Web3 + Python Project**
This is mainly a personal repository to store my code and notes while I'm learning the [web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) Python library.

Feel free to use anything you find on here for any purpose your heart desires. I am definitely okay with helping others learn about Cryptocurrency / Solidity development and the idea of Open Source.

I'll be adding different Python scripts to control Solidity and interact with Ethereum as I progress through the classes and learn.

### **Scripts for Testing**
There are a few test scripts available to verify your web3 installation's functionality. Find more detailed information about each script in the [/test directory's README](https://github.com/hiPirate/w3p/tree/main/tests)!
