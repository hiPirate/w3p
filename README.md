## **w3p: A Web3 + Python Project**
This is mainly just a personal repository while I'm learning web3.py. I'll be posting some different test/verification scripts, Solidity contracts (Called from Python and Solidity source), and possibly much more.

### **Prerequisites**
Besides the obvious prerequisites of ``Python`` and ``pip``, you must also install ``web3`` from pip:
```bash
pip install web3
```

### **Scripts for Testing**
There are a few test scripts available to verify your web3 installation's functionality. Find more detailed information about each script in the [/test directory's README](https://github.com/hiPirate/w3p/tree/main/tests)!
